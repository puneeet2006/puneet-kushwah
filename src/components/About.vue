          Since beginning my journey as a software developer nearly 5 years ago, I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. <br><br>
          As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
